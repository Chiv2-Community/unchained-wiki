CounterFeints You can feint a counter attempt if you make a mistake or your opponent changes their attack type Initiative When you take a hit or get blocked your opponent has the timing advantage, so block, evade or jab to recover! DamageFallOff A projectile will do less damage to targets further away. ArrowDrop Arrows will drop as they travel, aim up or down to adjust the range of your shot. DrawBow The longer you draw your bow, the more powerful the shot. HoldingDrawStam Holding an arrow drawn will cost you stamina.
