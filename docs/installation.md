# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and running the Chivalry 2 Unchained Launcher.

## Downloading the Launcher

[Download the Unchained Launcher](https://github.com/Chiv2-Community/UnchainedLauncher/releases/latest/download/UnchainedLauncher.exe){ .md-button }

To download the Unchained Launcher, click on the link above. Your browser may block the download; if it does, allow the download manually by clicking on the notification and selecting the option to keep the file.

## Running the Launcher

Once downloaded, locate the `UnchainedLauncher.exe` file and run it. Windows SmartScreen, a built-in security feature, checks downloaded files against a list of known safe programs. Because our launcher is new and not yet widely recognized, it might trigger a warning.

### How to Proceed Beyond SmartScreen

If you see a SmartScreen warning:
1. Click **"More info"**.
2. Click **"Run anyway"** to continue with the installation.

## Security Information

### Why Windows SmartScreen Shows a Warning

Windows SmartScreen assesses the reputation of software to help protect your computer. It checks reputation and signing details rather than inspecting the file's internal code. Because our launcher uses DLL injection—a necessary process for enabling mods in Chivalry 2—and is new, SmartScreen may flag it as unfamiliar, even though it is safe.

### Why Security Systems May Flag the Launcher

Some security systems might flag the Unchained Launcher as potentially malicious because it involves DLL injection into Chivalry 2. This process is required to enable mods and server hosting. While DLL injection is sometimes associated with malicious behavior, our launcher is entirely safe and not intended for malicious use.

### Open Source and Auditable Code

All the code used in Chivalry 2 Unchained is open source and available for review. You can inspect our DLLs and related tooling on the [Chiv2-Community GitHub organization](https://github.com/chiv2-community). We encourage you to audit the code to verify its safety.

## First-Time Setup

When you first run the launcher, it will:

1. Detect your Chivalry 2 installation
2. Set up the necessary files for modding
3. Present you with options for how you want to play

## Using the Launcher
