# Mod Setup Guide

This guide explains how to install mods for Chivalry 2 Unchained. Before proceeding, make sure you have already installed the Unchained Launcher by following the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

## Method 1: Using the Launcher's Mod Manager (Recommended)

The easiest way to install and manage mods is through the Unchained Launcher's built-in Mod Manager.

1. Open the Unchained Launcher
2. Navigate to the **Mod Manager** tab
3. Browse the list of available mods
4. Select a mod, then select `Enable` to enable the latest version.
5. To select a specific version of a mod:
   - Click on the version dropdown menu next to the mod
   - Select your desired version from the list

The Mod Manager automatically handles downloading, installation, and version management for you. It will also notify you when updates are available for your installed mods.

## Method 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer to install mods manually or have a mod that isn't available in the Mod Manager, follow these steps:

1. Locate your Chivalry 2 installation directory
  - Common locations are `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Chivalry2` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Chivalry 2`. If you use custom install directories their location 
    will be different.
   
2. Navigate to the Paks directory:
   ```
   [Chivalry 2 installation path]\TBL\Content\Paks
   ```

3. Place the mod `.pak` file directly into this directory
   - Ensure the file has the correct `.pak` extension
   - Do not modify the filename unless instructed to do so by the mod creator

4. Launch the game through the Unchained Launcher to use the installed mods

## Managing Manually Installed Mods

To disable a manually installed mod:
- Remove the `.pak` file from the Paks directory, or
- Rename the file by adding `.disabled` to the end (e.g., `MyMod.pak.disabled`)

To update a manually installed mod:
- Delete the old version of the mod
- Place the new version in the Paks directory

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with mods:

- Ensure you're running the game through the Unchained Launcher
- Try disabling other mods to check for conflicts
- Verify the mod file is properly placed in the correct directory
