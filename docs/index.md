Chivalry 2 Unchained is a set of tools made by the community, for the community, that allows users to host their own modded servers and create mods

## Getting started
Chivalry 2 does not allow mods by default, so it must be run through a custom launcher. Whether you want to just play modded chivalry 2, host your own servers, or develop your own mods, you will need the Unchained Launcher.

## Installation Process

[Download the Unchained Launcher](https://github.com/Chiv2-Community/UnchainedLauncher/releases/latest/download/UnchainedLauncher.exe){ .md-button }

### Downloading the Launcher
To download the Unchained Launcher, click on the download link above. Your browser may block the download, in which case you will need to allow it manually. In most browsers, you can do this by clicking on the download notification and selecting the option to keep the file.

### Running the Launcher
Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file (UnchainedLauncher.exe) and run it. Windows security may try to prevent it from running. If you see a warning message, click on "More info" and then select "Run anyway" to proceed with the installation.

## Security Concerns

### Why Security Systems May Think the Launcher is Malicious
Security systems may flag the Unchained Launcher as potentially malicious because it involves injecting a DLL into Chivalry 2. This is necessary because Chivalry 2 does not allow mods and server hosting by default, and the only way to enable mods is through this injection process. Unfortunately, DLL injections are commonly used by hackers, which is why security systems may consider it suspicious.

### Open Source and Auditable Code
All code utilized by Chivalry 2 Unchained is open source and available for anyone to audit. You can find our DLLs and all related tooling on the [Chiv2-Community GitHub organization](https://github.com/chiv2-community). We encourage you to review the code and verify its safety.
