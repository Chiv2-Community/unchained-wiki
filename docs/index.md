Chivalry 2 Unchained is a set of tools made by the community, for the community, that allows users to host their own modded servers and create mods

## Getting started
Chivalry 2 does not allow mods by default, so it must be run through a custom launcher. Whether you want to just play modded chivalry 2, host your own servers, or develop your own mods, you will need the Unchained Launcher.
