## Getting Started

Since Chivalry 2 does not support mods by default, the game must be launched via the Unchained Launcher. Whether you want to play with regular Chivalry with client-side mods, host or play on your own servers, or develop your own mods, the launcher is your gateway.

## Chivalry 2 Unchained Launcher Modes of Operation

1. **Official Unmodded Mode**  
   Launch Chivalry 2 (Torn Banner Official) for the standard, unmodified game experience.


2. **Client-Side Modding Mode**  
   Run Chivalry 2 with client-side mods on official multiplayer servers. These mods can cosmetically change or enhance the game for you. Examples include:
   - **dripsync:** Maintain and dynamically switch between preset heraldry and character configurations.
   - **nightlife:** Enable nighttime versions of all Chivalry 2 maps.
   - [in development] Detailed logging of in-game events for statistics and score tracking.
   - [in development] Enhancements for competitive and community events.


3. **Full Unchained Multiplayer Mode**  
   Connect to custom Unchained modded servers using the Chivalry 2 Unchained server list. This mode supports standalone server-hosted mods that can introduce major gameplay changes, such as:
   - Custom Maps, Weapons, Classes, etc.
   - 'Giant slayers' mode.
   - Potential PvE cooperative horde mode.
   - Mods which require all clients to have the mod to play.
   

The Unchained launcher also integrates tooling to manage your Chivalry 2 modifications collection via a mod repository to download, update, and manage mods easily. The Unchained Launcher also contains the capability to manage server hosting settings and run a 'headless' server for Chivalry 2 for play on local LAN or via the internet with other Chivalry Unchained players.

## Unchained Launcher Installation Process

[Download the Unchained Launcher](https://github.com/Chiv2-Community/UnchainedLauncher/releases/latest/download/UnchainedLauncher.exe){ .md-button }

### Downloading the Launcher

To download the Unchained Launcher, click on the link above. Your browser may block the download; if it does, allow the download manually by clicking on the notification and selecting the option to keep the file.

### Running the Launcher

Once downloaded, locate the `UnchainedLauncher.exe` file and run it. Windows SmartScreen, a built-in security feature, checks downloaded files against a list of known safe programs. Because our launcher is new and not yet widely recognized, it might trigger a warning.

#### How to Proceed beyond smartscreen
If you see a SmartScreen warning:
1. Click **"More info"**.
2. Click **"Run anyway"** to continue with the installation.

## Security Concerns
### Why Windows SmartScreen Shows a Warning
Windows SmartScreen assesses the reputation of software to help protect your computer. It checks reputation and signing details rather than inspecting the file's internal code. Because our launcher uses DLL injection—a necessary process for enabling mods in Chivalry 2—and is new, SmartScreen may flag it as unfamiliar, even though it is safe.

### Why Security Systems May Flag the Launcher
Some security systems might flag the Unchained Launcher as potentially malicious because it involves DLL injection into Chivalry 2. This process is required to enable mods and server hosting. While DLL injection is sometimes associated with malicious behavior, our launcher is entirely safe and not intended for malicious use.

### Open Source and Auditable Code
All the code used in Chivalry 2 Unchained is open source and available for review. You can inspect our DLLs and related tooling on the [Chiv2-Community GitHub organization](https://github.com/chiv2-community). We encourage you to audit the code to verify its safety.
