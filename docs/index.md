## What Can You Do With Chivalry 2 Unchained?

Since Chivalry 2 does not support mods by default, the game must be launched via the Unchained Launcher. Our launcher is your gateway to an enhanced Chivalry 2 experience.

### Play Your Way

The Unchained Launcher offers multiple ways to enjoy Chivalry 2:

#### Official Unmodded Mode
Launch Chivalry 2 (Torn Banner Official) for the standard, unmodified game experience.

#### Client-Side Modding Mode
Run Chivalry 2 with client-side mods on official multiplayer servers. These mods can cosmetically change or enhance the game for you. Examples include:
* **dripsync:** Maintain and dynamically switch between preset heraldry and character configurations.
* **nightlife:** Enable nighttime versions of all Chivalry 2 maps.
* [in development] Detailed logging of in-game events for statistics and score tracking.
* [in development] Enhancements for competitive and community events.

#### Unchained Multiplayer Mode 
Connect to custom Unchained modded servers using the Chivalry 2 Unchained server list. This mode supports standalone server-hosted mods that can introduce major gameplay changes, such as:
* Custom Maps, Weapons, Classes, etc.
* 'Giant slayers' mode.
* Potential PvE cooperative horde mode.
* Mods which require all clients to have the mod to play.

#### Unchained Server Hosting Mode
Host your own Chivalry 2 servers with custom map rotations, mods and whatever network settings you desire. You can enable higher tickrates, more difficult bots, set restrictions on classes and more. Check out our [Server Hosting Guide](server-hosting/setup-guide.md) to get started.
